# PHP RSS Updater

This is an example application based on a interviewee exercise for M&Co.

## Specification

The spec for the exercise is to create a RSS feed reader which will save the contents of the feed to JSON file. Subsequent requests of the RSS feed should identify if there are new items to be saved to the JSON file. If there are new items, update the JSON file otherwise do nothing.

It is simple enough that it can be completed quickly. However, the resulting application should provide some insight into the capabilities of the interviewee.
